I want the internet to be a place of no-bullshit information and personal anecdotes.

This page is a collection of my notes, thoughts, and resources that I find useful.

This page is built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). It offers some keyboard shortcuts:

- <kbd>F</kbd>, <kbd>S</kbd> or <kbd>/</kbd> opens the search bar.
- <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>,</kbd> navigates to the previous page.
- <kbd>N</kbd> or <kbd>.</kbd> navigates to the next page.
